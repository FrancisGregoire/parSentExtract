# parSentExtract
A BiRNN framework implemented in Python and TensorFlow to extract parallel sentences from aligned comparable corpora.

Code for the A Deep Neural Network Approach To Parallel Sentence Extraction paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.09783)

Only Jupyter notebooks to train a model and extract sentence pairs are available for the moment. Refactored source code will be pushed shortly.
